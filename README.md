# Hospital Management App

Hospital Management App is a MERN web application developed for the IFN636 Software Life Cycle Management assessment. 
The application provides basic hospital ward and patient management functionality for doctors and nurses.

## Features

* User login and authentication using JWT
* Doctor and nurse role-based access
* View hospital wards
* View patients assigned to each ward
* View patient records
* Admit new patients
* Edit basic patient details
* Transfer patients between wards
* Discharge patients

Some functionality is restricted by role. For example, only doctors can admit and transfer patients.

## Architecture

The application uses the MERN stack:

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Node.js and Express
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* **Deployment:** Amazon EC2

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST API endpoints. The Express backend handles authentication, authorisation, validation and database operations using Mongoose.

## Local Setup

### Requirements

* Node.js
* npm
* MongoDB Atlas database

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/ChristopherNHorsfall/HospitalManagementApp
cd HospitalManagementApp
npm run install-all


Create a '.env' file inside the 'backend' directory containing:


PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<MongoDB Atlas connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<JWT secret>


Start the application from the project root:

'
npm start
'

The frontend will run at:

'
http://localhost:3000
'

The backend runs on port '5000'.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to an Amazon EC2 instance.

**Deployment URL:**
'http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:3000'

The EC2 public IP will change when the instance is stopped and restarted. 

## Known Limitations

* The application currently supports only doctor and nurse workflows implemented for the first sprint.
* Patient medical information such as medications and history is not yet editable.
* Discharging a patient currently removes the patient record from the database rather than retaining an archived medical record.
* Ward capacity and bed allocation are not currently managed.
* The application uses a basic development deployment configuration suitable for assessment demonstration rather than a production environment.
* The EC2 public IP address may change after the instance is stopped and restarted.

## Version Control

Development is managed using Git and GitHub with feature branches and regular commits associated with project jira stories and subtasks.
